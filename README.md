....

# PROJECT OBJECTIVE:
Retirement brings a slower pace of life. No more sweating work deadlines, playing office politics or struggling to stay afloat in a city with a soul-crushing commute and a punitive cost of living. The end of your career also raises new questions about where and how to spend your days now that youâ€™re no longer tied to a specific location.
 For this project i looked into affordability, wellness, culture, weather and crime of each states in the USA to best make a data driven decision on the best state to retire to.
